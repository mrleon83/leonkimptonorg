	      <p class="content">I am a creative person and as you will see, I develop websites, have a keen interest in photography, and in my free time I'm a multi-instrumentalist. I have a Youtube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpm1P0ZJ1PABgRkZXINg8aw">Dragon Heart Studio</a> which also chronicles my desire to learn to sing!</p>
	      <p class="content">After many years of working in the insurance industry, I sought a more enriching career. As I have a natural aptitude to computer programming, I embarked on a study program with the Open University. I have so far completed the Diploma of Higher Education in Computing and IT, with a view to complete the final stage of my studies to obtain a Degree in Computing and IT in the future.</p>
	      <p class="content">I am currently employed as a Junior Web Developer using PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS and Microsoft SQL, and have been in my post for over 1 year.</p>
	      <p class="content">At this moment, I am procuring additional projects to expand my skills and to challenge myself to learn new technologies and methodology.</p>
